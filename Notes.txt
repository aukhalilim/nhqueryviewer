Unit test coverage - XUnit + Mocking framework (Rhino Mocks or MoQ) 
Must add Castle Windsor IOC container - should I use a new container for learning purposes - what about Unity?
Must consolidate all configuration into a single place
Must expose NHibernate statistics
Must possibly have a reporting engine
What about sessions and session factories that are in use - we should expose this at the front
UI - Web or windows app MVC/WPF ???
