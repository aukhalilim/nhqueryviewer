Must add Castle Windsor IOC container - should I use a new container for learning purposes - what about Unity?
Must consolidate all configuration into a single place
Must possibly have a reporting engine
Support for multiple session factories
UI - Web or windows app MVC/WPF ???
Go long namespaced with all NHibernate and castle stuff - not consistent at the moment!
Must consolidate all dependencies and invert control where applicable - build castle file
UOW implementation
